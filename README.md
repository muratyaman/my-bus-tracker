# my-bus-tracker
My Bus Tracker is a small app to show buses of San Francisco on a map (React + D3 + SVG map using GeoJSON data)

To see it in action, run:

npm install

npm start

Then, open http://localhost:3000

It will load neighbourhoods and streets of San Francisco. Then, it will get a list of bus routes to fill the route selector. When you can select a route, it will get the locations of the buses operating on that route, and display them as litle red dots on the map.
